# Multi-Currency Payment

Buzzvel 2026 Dev Team Test — corporate multi-currency payment request system.

Employees submit payment requests in their local currency. Exchange rates are fetched at creation time and stored immutably. The finance team reviews and approves or rejects requests.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Docker Engine + Compose v2)

No need to install PHP, Node, Composer, or pnpm on the host — everything runs in containers.

## Environment files (committed for reviewers)

This is a **test submission**, so `.env` and `backend/.env` are **committed to the repository** on purpose. That is not recommended for production, but it lets reviewers run the stack without copying example files or hunting for API keys.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Docker Compose (port, MySQL credentials) |
| `backend/.env` | Laravel app config, including `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` |

After clone, you should not need to edit anything unless you want to change the port or use your own exchange-rate API key.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd multi-currency-payments
docker compose up -d --build
```

**First boot can take a few minutes** (Composer install, Laravel migrate/seed, Next.js build). Wait until **all** containers are healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see `backend`, `frontend`, and `database` as **healthy** before opening the UI. The stack is wired so the frontend does not start until the API has finished bootstrapping and demo data is seeded (`php artisan app:ready`).

Then open:

| URL | Purpose |
|---|---|
| http://localhost:8080 | UI |
| http://localhost:8080/docs/api | Interactive API docs (Scramble) |
| http://localhost:8080/api/health | Health check |

### What happens automatically on first start

The `backend` container bootstraps the API:

1. `composer install` (if `vendor/` is missing)
2. `php artisan key:generate` (if `APP_KEY` is empty)
3. `php artisan migrate --force`
4. `php artisan db:ensure-seeded` (demo users and payments when data is missing)
5. `php artisan scramble:analyze` + `scramble:export` (OpenAPI docs validated at bootstrap)
6. Writes `storage/framework/.bootstrap-complete` and exposes a healthcheck (`php artisan app:ready`)

The `frontend` container waits for `backend` to be **healthy** before starting Next.js. The `webserver` waits for both `frontend` and `backend` to be healthy, then exposes port 8080 only when `/api/health` **and** `/docs/api` (Scramble) respond — so the UI and interactive API docs are guaranteed on `docker compose up`.

The `scheduler` container also waits for `backend` to be healthy, then runs `php artisan schedule:work` (expires pending payments older than 48 hours every minute).

**You do not need** to run `key:generate` or `migrate --seed` manually for a normal Docker setup.

## Payment expiration (48h)

Pending requests that finance does not approve or reject within **48 hours** are marked `expired` automatically.

### How it works

1. The `scheduler` container runs `php artisan schedule:work`.
2. Every minute it runs `php artisan payments:expire-pending`.
3. That command updates all `pending` rows whose `created_at` is older than 48 hours to `expired`.

Demo seed data includes one pending payment per employee **just under the configured window** (default 47h55m) so reviewers can see expirations within a few minutes of `docker compose up`, without waiting two days.

**Local testing:** set `PAYMENT_PENDING_EXPIRATION_HOURS=1` in `backend/.env`, then `docker compose restart backend scheduler`. Re-seed if needed (`docker compose exec backend php artisan db:seed --class=PaymentSeeder`). Pending demo rows will expire ~5 minutes after creation.

### Why a scheduled command instead of a queued Job?
I considered dispatching a delayed `ExpirePaymentJob` when each payment is created (`->delay(48 hours)`). We chose a **scheduled Artisan command** that scans the database instead:

| | Scheduled command (what we built) | Delayed Job per payment |
|---|---|---|
| **Fits the rule** | “Expire everything pending older than 48h” is naturally a batch query | Better when each payment needs its own exact expiry moment |
| **Docker setup** | Only needs the existing `scheduler` container | Would also need a `queue:work` process always running |
| **Resilience** | If the scheduler is down for a while, the next run catches all overdue rows | Depends on Redis, worker uptime, and job retries |
| **Seeded / backfilled data** | Works immediately for old `created_at` values | Only expires payments that had a job dispatched at create time |
| **Changing the window** | Update `PAYMENT_PENDING_EXPIRATION_HOURS` — next run uses the new cutoff | Already-queued jobs keep their old delay |

For this test project the rule is simple, the volume is small, and we wanted reviewers to run `docker compose up` without extra moving parts. A command plus scheduler is the usual Laravel pattern for this kind of housekeeping.

If we later needed per-payment notifications at the exact expiry second, we could add Jobs on top — or run the command less often (e.g. hourly) in production.

Configuration: `config/payments.php` / `PAYMENT_PENDING_EXPIRATION_HOURS` in `backend/.env`.

### Optional setup script

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This only starts Docker — bootstrap still runs inside the `backend` entrypoint.

## Seed credentials

Password for **all** seeded users: `123456`

On the login screen, open **Test instructions** to see the full list of finance and employee accounts.

| Email | Role | Country | Currency |
|---|---|---|---|
| `finance@buzzvel.com` | finance | Portugal | EUR |
| `rafael@buzzvel.com` | employee | Brazil | BRL |
| `emily@buzzvel.com` | employee | United States | USD |
| `oliver@buzzvel.com` | employee | United Kingdom | GBP |
| `yuki@buzzvel.com` | employee | Japan | JPY |

More users are seeded — see `backend/database/seeders/UserSeeder.php` or `GET /api/test-users`.

## Exchange rate API

Payment creation fetches a live EUR → local rate from [ExchangeRate-API v6](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). A key is already set in `backend/.env` (`EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY`).

The amount shown in the form is a **reference estimate** only; the locked rate is fetched when you submit.

To use your own key, edit `backend/.env` and restart:

```bash
docker compose restart backend scheduler
```

## Running tests

PHPUnit uses a **separate MySQL database** (`payments_test`), not the demo `payments` database. `RefreshDatabase` can safely run `migrate:fresh` during tests without wiping seeded users or payments.

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
# or
docker compose exec backend php artisan db:ensure-test-database
docker compose exec backend php artisan test
```

**Critical subset** (payments + expiration):

```bash
docker compose exec backend php artisan test --filter='PaymentExpiration|PaymentService|PaymentImmutability|ExpirePendingPayments|PaymentCreate'
```

**SQLite (in-memory, no MySQL setup):**

```bash
./scripts/test-sqlite.sh
# or
docker compose exec backend php artisan test --configuration=phpunit.sqlite.xml
```

On first boot, the entrypoint creates `payments_test` automatically. If you already had a Docker volume before this was added, run `db:ensure-test-database` once (or recreate the volume with `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`).

## API documentation

- **Interactive (Scramble):** http://localhost:8080/docs/api
- **Static reference:** [docs/api.md](docs/api.md)
- **Architecture:** [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)

## Useful commands

```bash
# Logs (all services or one)
docker compose logs -f
docker compose logs -f backend

# Stop
docker compose down

# Rebuild after Dockerfile / entrypoint changes
docker compose up -d --build

# Artisan
docker compose exec backend php artisan <command>
```

## Troubleshooting

**`pull access denied` for `multi-currency/*` images**

Harmless on first run — Docker tries to pull local image names, then builds them from this repo.

**Frontend stuck on “Waiting”**

Normal on first boot while Next.js builds. Check progress with `docker compose logs -f frontend` (allow 2–3 minutes).

**Composer / `vendor/` errors on first start**

If `backend` and `scheduler` previously raced on `composer install`, reset vendor and rebuild:

```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf backend/vendor
docker compose up -d --build
```

**Payment submit fails — exchange rate unavailable**

Check `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` in `backend/.env` and restart `backend`. With `APP_DEBUG=true`, the API returns a more specific error message.

**Completely fresh database**

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans -v
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Development notes

- The frontend talks to the API via same-origin paths (`/api`, `/sanctum`) through Nginx — use **http://localhost:8080**, not port 3000 directly.
- `backend/vendor/` is gitignored and installed inside Docker on first boot.
- For standalone frontend dev without Nginx, see [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md).
